            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our aim is to raise awareness about the sport of table tennis as it is one of
                the lesser known sports. We
                hope to spread the joy of the sport and help as many people as possible to discover table tennis! Table
                tennis is a sport of many benefits including: increased alertness and concentration, improved hand-eye
                coordination, and stimulated brain function. Through training at True North TTC, anyone can fully
                experience all of these benefits!Whether you're just getting started or youâ€™re a relatively experienced
                player, we will have a coach to pair you up with and many opportunities for you to practice with
                different players. If you have any questions about training tips or how to start playing table tennis,
                then contact @james_y_u(instagram). We hope to see you here in the future!</p>
